## Project Overview
**Candy Factory** is a Java-based simulation that models how a candy store manages both in-person and online sales.  
The system allows customers to browse products, place orders, and track deliveries while the store manages inventory, processes orders, and applies promotional features.

The project is structured with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles and uses several core **design patterns** to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

## Design Patterns Implemented
| Pattern | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Factory Pattern** | Dynamically creates different candy types (e.g., Chocolate, Gummy, Hard Candy). |
| **Observer Pattern** | Notifies users/systems when inventory levels change or when an order is updated. |
| **Singleton Pattern** | Ensures one instance of the main database/order manager. |
| **Decorator Pattern** | Adds extra features to candies (e.g., packaging, discounts, or seasonal themes) without altering core classes. |
